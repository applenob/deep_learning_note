# Info
This notebook is just for practice, help me to understand basic neural network and its implementation.

I didn't write all the code by myself,
some of the code is from [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).
Here is his [blog](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
some of the code is from [the class of udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730/lessons/6370362152/concepts/63798118150923).
